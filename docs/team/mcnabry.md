### Project: Jobby

Jobby is a desktop app for managing job applications and contacts,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Jobby can help you manage tracking your job applications and contacts in a more streamlined fashion.
