## Introduction

  Welcome to the **Jobby** User Guide!

  **Jobby** is a **desktop app designed for Computer Science students looking for a systematic way to manage their job applications and networking contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Jobby can help you manage tracking your job applications and contacts in a more streamlined fashion. If you can type fast, Jobby can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

  It is assumed that you know how the job application process is like, and that you know how to look for job applications.

### Purpose of this guide

  The purpose of this guide is to get you familiar with the features of **Jobby** - from the very basics, to the most advanced features the application has to offer. These features range from the simple task of adding an contacts into the application for tracking to how our application can assist you in tracking every steps of your application process. We will go through every feature **Jobby** has to offer within this guide. You can check out the Table of Contents to navigate to a feature you might be interested in using.

basic workflow of Jobby. However, there are still many features that we have yet introduced. Please refer to the [Using Jobby Section](#using-jobby) to understand
the command structure of Jobby, or visit [Features Section](#features) to see the full capabilities of Jobby!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using Jobby

This section explains the details of how we can interact with Jobby.

If you're looking for the list of available commands, check out the [Features](#features) section instead.

### Command Structure

<span class="learning-outcome pill">:trophy: How to understand and write Jobby commands</span> <span class="beginner pill">Beginner</span>

In Jobby, we write commands in the command box at the top of Jobby's window.

Commands are made up of a few parts: The **command**, **parameter names** and **input values**.

A command like "`edit google --name Google SG --id google-sg`" would refer to:
* the **command** `edit`,
* with a **command value** `google`,
* with a **parameter** `--name`,
  * which has the **parameter value** `Google SG`,
* with a **parameter** `--id`,
  * which has the **parameter value** `google-sg`.

Parameters may be in any order, whose names are of the form `-a` or `--abc123`, and must be surrounded by whitespace.

Any extra parameters and values to commands that don't accept them will either be ignored or throw an error.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:bulb: Additional information:**<br>

* Parameter names are restricted to the `-`/`--` prefix, contain only letters and numbers, and must begin with a letter.

* Any parameter names not following the required format will be treated as data input, so an input like *"-5 degrees"* will work.

* Although Jobby's syntax resembles the usual Unix syntax, you should not quote your text, and you should not leave a trailing `=`.

</div>

### Command Explanations

<span class="learning-outcome pill">:trophy: How to interpret this guide's command explanations</span> <span class="beginner pill">Beginner</span>

Throughout this guide, you will find symbols and placeholders used to describe a command format. They are:

* **Words in `UPPER_CASE`**

  * The parts where you should be typing your parameter values.

  * e.g., `--name NAME` means inputting names along the lines of `--name Alice`.

* **Terms separated by `/` or `|`**

  * Exactly one of the given options.

  * These may be included in the parameter names or value description.

  * e.g., `--a/--b` means either `--a` or `--b` but not `--a --b`.

* **Terms surrounded by `[` and `]`**

  * An optional parameter or option that may be omitted.

  * e.g., `[--id ID]` means you may omit setting an ID for the command.

* **Terms ending with `...`**

  * The parameter is multivalued.

  * e.g., `[--tag TAG]...` means `--tag` and its value can be repeated from 0 to any number of times.



### Command Autocomplete

<span class="learning-outcome pill">:trophy: How to use Jobby's command autocompletion</span> <span class="beginner pill">Beginner</span>

Command autocompletion allows you to type commands in Jobby at unimaginable speeds.

As you type your command, you may see a list of suggested completions pop up.
Just press **TAB** or **SPACE** to select the first suggestion to fill in that text!

![Autocomplete Screenshot](images/autocomplete.png)

To temporarily hide all suggestions, press **ESC**. This temporarily disables autocompletion for the next keystroke.

If suggestions were hidden or aren't shown when they should, press **TAB** to prompt Jobby to bring it back.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:bulb: Additional tips:** <br>

* If you rather choose from the list instead of typing out the prefix, it is possible to use the **UP** and **DOWN**
  arrow keys to navigate through the menu, then press **ENTER** to select them.

* Accidentally triggered autocomplete when you didn't intend to? Don't worry, just press **BACKSPACE** to immediately
  revert to your previously typed text.

* <span class="expert pill">Expert</span> Autocomplete checks for fuzzy matches - it sorts by the best *subsequence* prefix match first.

  * For example, you can type `-nm` to get the autocompletion result of `--name`.

  * This allows you to quickly choose between parameter names with similar prefixes, e.g., by typing
    `-dsp` to select `--description` instead of `--descending`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:warning: Limitations:**<br>

* Autocomplete is not autocorrect. It will not attempt to correct mistyped details.

* Autocomplete suggests plausible values you may want to add onto your partially typed command. It does not verify that the command will run.

</div>

```

* When adding in parameters, be aware of the [accepted parameters](#appendix-a-acceptable-values-for-parameters).
* If an `ID` is not specified, one will be automatically generated.
* To link a <span class="jobby-data-class">Recruiter</span> to an <span class="jobby-data-class">Organization</span> in the contacts list, make sure you include `--oid` and pass in the `ID` of the <span class="jobby-data-class">Organization</span> you want to link to.
